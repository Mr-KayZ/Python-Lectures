# Python-Lectures
Crash course info on how to program in Python. All files are in a .ipynb format (AKA Jupyter Notebooks). The HTML format can be found in the HTML folder. All extra notes can be found in the "Extra notes" folder, for example Functions and Classes/Objects.

Note that you can still read the Jupyter Notebooks and Python Files in Github directly!

You can utilize online IDEs, such as Replit and such for running the code. You can also download Anaconda Python and run the python files and Jupyter notebooks in VS code as well.
