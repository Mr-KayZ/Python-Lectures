    "One of the great things about Python is the fact that it has numerous packages that exist online, and how easy to use many of them are. Some of the more relevant ones include `Numpy` and `Basic Math Package`, for instance. They are widely used for multiple applications and fields, such as data science, AI building, Machine learning, etc.\n",
