    "### **For Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "For loops in Python are used to iterate over items of any sequence, such as a list or string.\n",
    "They follow the structure `for {value} in {sequence}` and the statements after in indents...\n",
    "One notable difference from while loops is the fact they don't need initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop can keep on going on until the last item in the for loop is met.\n",
    "This can be achieved with the use of the range function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Range Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function is a built-in that is used to iterate over a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "It follows this syntax: `range( {start}, {stop}, {Step} )`, with `{step}` being optional.\n",
    "If `{step}` is not specified, it automatically is taken as 1.\n",
    "Pretty simple right? We can use it with for loops to give out a set of numbers.\n",
    "We can even get a user input and output the answer with the range function and `{step}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want odd numbers from 1 to n (included). And we get the user input of n:"

    "    # For a number between 1 and n+1 (we wrote n+1 because we want n as well)...\n",
    "    # We give a value of i after every 2 numbers per iteration.\n",
    "    # Since we started with 1, the next number will be 3 (2 steps).\n",

    "And that is it. The above program gives us all odd numbers to a value inputted by the user.\n",
    "It can be reformatted to give even numbers as well, but you get the idea.\n",
    "For loops can be used with greater flexibility than normal while loops for more specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in while loops, they are carried out until a condition is false.\n",
    "However, for loops don't exactly have a condition. They are used for a sequence.\n",
    "And this is where else statements come in to greater use in for loops.\n",
