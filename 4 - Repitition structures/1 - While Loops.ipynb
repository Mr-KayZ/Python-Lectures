    "# 4.1 - Repetition structures\n",
    "Repetition structures are a fundamental part of any programming language. They allow iterative programming and whatnot to occur, which is very important if we wanna make a program do something or repeat something multiple times, with each iteration bringing in a modification to the \"code\". There are many examples of this, but we will look at the basics of how to make a repetition structure.\n",
